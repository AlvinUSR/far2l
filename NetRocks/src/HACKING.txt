Architecture overview:
[PluginImpl] --{aggregation}--> [IHost:HostRemote,HostLocal]
                                          |
                              {IPC to dedicated process}
                                          |
                                          V
                                 [HostRemoteBroker]
                                          |
                                   {aggregation}
                                          |
                                          V
                          [IProtocol:ProtocolSFTP,ProtocolFile]

To add additional protocol:
- Add protocol-specific prefix into GetPluginInfoW in NetRocks.cpp
- Write IProtocol implementation: see Protocol/ProtocolSFTP.cpp as example
- Add protocol instantiation into InitConnection() in Host/HostRemoteBroker.cpp
- Add protocol-specific prefix in several places of UI/Settings/SiteConnectionEditor.cpp
- If need: implement protocol-specific configuration dialog like UI/Settings/ProtocolOptionsSFTP.cpp and use it from SiteConnectionEditor::ProtocolOptions
- Dont forget to add new .cpp files into CMakeLists.txt
- Keep in mind that protocol implementation hosted in separate process, so it cannot interchange any data via global variables etc
